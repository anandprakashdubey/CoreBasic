>> dotnet publish --help
>> dotnet publish -o c:\WorkSpace\DotNetCore\Publish\1     { -o is output path }

When we use NPM in Dotnet project and when we publish the proeject, node_modules does not include. So in order to add during publish we need to add few code in web project .csproj file.

	<Target Name="PostBuild" AfterTargets="ComputeFilesToPublish">
		<Exec Command="npm install"/>
	</Target>

	<ItemGroup>
		<Content Include="node_modules/**" CopyToPublishDirectory="PreserveNewest"/>
	</ItemGroup>

And after this, delete ItemGroup which has node_modules include instructions.


****Publishing File with Self Contained Options, but we have to give Runtime Identifier  we can get it from RID website
.net core RID catalog

>> dotnet publish -o c:\WorkSpace\DotNetCore\Publish\1  --self-contained  -r win-x64 { --self-contained will create package which will be OS independent }

>> dotnet publish -o c:\WorkSpace\Publish\1 --self-contained -r win-x64

where win-x64 is RID for 64 bit Win OS

So after publishing self-contained, we can the app with "CoreDemo.exe CoreDemo.dll" dotnet cli command is not available in OS that's why we use exe space command.
